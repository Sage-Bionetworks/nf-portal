###December 2016 - Data Update
The [**MSBB**](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3159438) study. A final sample QC has been completed for the Whole Exome Sequencing and RNA sequencing. The following QC and corrections have been made
* [WES](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4645334)
       * A sample QC was done by an all vs. all genotype similarity comparison. This identified 14 samples that were found to be outliers for showing excessive sample relatedness with at least one sample. These samples were discarded from further study.
       * Plink genotypes were QCd by removing individuals with missing rate > 0.5. SNPs with MAF < 0.01, missing genotyping rate > 0.5, or HWE test P value < 0.001 were removed.
       * Bam files, Plink and a VCF file has been provided for the final dataset
&nbsp;
* [RNAseq](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3157743)
       * For RNA samples sequenced multiple times the fastq file which had the largest number of mapped reads and less than 5% rRNA mapped reads were selected. Variants were called on the RNA-seq data using GATK and gender information imputed for each sample using RNA expression and the WES data when possible. The heterozygous variants from the RNA-seq data were compared to the variants in the WES data, in order to assign each RNA-seq sample to its corresponding DNA sequence. These multiple layers of information were used to correct, when necessary, mislabeling. For RNA-seq samples with documented matching WES the sample was removed if the discordance rate between RNA-seq sample and its best corresponding exome sequence was more than 10%. This removed 394 samples from the dataset for a final set of 1030 samples from 301 individuals.
       * Bam files, raw gene counts and normalized counts have been provided for the final dataset
&nbsp;
* [Metadata](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn7392158)
       * The clinical file and separate WES and RNAseq covariate files have been aggregated into a Metadata folder. The most recent version of the WES and RNAseq covariate files contain the final QCd dataset. In addition, the most recent version of the RNAseq covariate file corrects for mislabeled samples by mapping them to the correct individual ID.

###First AMP-AD Data Release: March 3 2015
This release was largely comprised of existing, pre-award data from human samples that was used in generating preliminary results on the grant applications of the U01 AMP-AD projects.

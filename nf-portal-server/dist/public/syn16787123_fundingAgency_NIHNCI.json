Our investigative team will characterize the adaptive responses of PNs to these kinase inhibitors in GEM models and in parallel studies in patients. The aims of Project 1 are: Aim 1: Evaluate tumor and circulating markers before and after treatment with the MEK inhibitor selumetinib in pediatric and adult patients with NF1 associated plexiform neurofibromas. Aim 2: Evaluate the molecular adaptive responses, PK/PD and clinical response of plexiform neurofibromas in genetically engineered mice (GEM) with selumetinib alone, and in combination with imatinib mesylate. Aim 3: Utilize GEM models to identify the optimal therapeutic window(s) of c-kit (SCF) inhibition at distinct embryonic and adult stages of PN formation utilizing Nf1flox/- and Nf1flox/-;Scf flox/flox mice under the transcriptional control of a PLP tamoxifen + Cre transgene. The translational impact of this project involves: (1) defining therapeutic window(s) for c-kit inhibition at distinct embryonic and adult stages of PN formation; (2) investigating a rational approach to combinatorial therapy based on simultaneously interfering with paracrine growth signals emanating from the tumor microenvironment while also targeting aberrant Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation in tumor cells; and (3) defining novel biomarkers by analyzing tumor specimens and blood obtained both prior to and after treatment.","https://trp.cancer.gov/spores/abstracts/indiana_hyperactive.htm","Wade Clapp | Jaishri Blakeley | Brigitte Widemann | Lu Le","Indiana University School of Medicine | Johns Hopkins Medical Institute | National Institute of Health | University of Texas, Southwestern","Plexiform Neurofibroma","Neurofibromatosis 1",null]},{"rowId":157,"versionNumber":28,"values":["DHART SPORE Project 2: Targeted Therapies for Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNST)","syn5714289","syn17038350","Active","Under Embargo","NIH-NCI","The major goals of Project 2 are to translate these provocative preclinical data and to harness functional imaging to develop better markers of early response in MPNST.

SMNs are a fundamental problem in cancer survivors. Compelling data generated by Drs. Nakamura and Shannon in GEM mice demonstrated that irradiation cooperates strongly with heterozygous Nf1 inactivation in the development of a spectrum of SMNs that recapitulate common SMNs in human patients with and without NF1. Project 4 will translate these novel data and will systematically assess the incidence of SMNs in NF1 patients and examine associated risk factors such as age at diagnosis, anatomic site of the primary tumor, and dose and duration of prior treatment. Data compiled by the NCI-funded Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) will play an integral role in Project 4. The aims of Project 4 are: Aim 1. To describe the magnitude of risk of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in individuals with NF1. Aim 2. To perform comparative oncogenomics to identify genetic alterations associated with radiation-induced tumorigenesis in individuals with NF1. Aim 3. To validate in model systems the biologic importance of candidate pathways in radiation-induced tumorigenesis and to determine whether radiotherapy promotes transformation of plexiform neurofibromas to MPNSTs in vivo. The translational impact of this work involves informing current clinical practice in the treatment of tumors arising in NF1 patients to reduce the risk of SMN, and generating insights into the underlying biology of SMN that will lead to new therapies for these common, aggressive, and largely refractory cancers.","https://trp.cancer.gov/spores/abstracts/indiana_hyperactive.htm","Smita Bhatia | Jean L.

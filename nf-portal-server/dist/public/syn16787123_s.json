This unique consortium brings together a multidisciplinary team of scientists from twelve world-class labs at academic and medical centers of excellence, who have pledged to work closely together - sharing information, datasets, results and more - at every step in research development, with the goal of speeding up the drug discovery process. The end goal of this effort is to find new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of two primary NF2-related tumors: schwannoma and meningioma. The expectation is to take the work from discovery to pre-clinical development, resulting in the development of an Investigational New Drug (IND) for NF2. Presently, two of three data releases have been conducted, with high-throughput drug screening data and more gene expression/kinomics data to be released in the future.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2343195/wiki/62125","Jaishri Blakeley | Wade Clapp | James Gusella | Scott Plotkin","Johns Hopkins Medical Institute | Indiana University | Massachusetts General Hospital | Harvard Medical School | University of Central Florida | FLI-Leibniz-Germany | University of North Carolina | Ohio State University | Sage Bionetworks | Children's Tumor Foundation","Schwannoma | Meningioma","Neurofibromatosis 2","yes"]},{"rowId":133,"versionNumber":37,"values":["A Nerve Sheath Tumor Bank from Patients with NF1","syn4939902","syn13363852","Active","Under Embargo","NTAP","Surgery is currently the only treatment option for NF patients with symptomatic plexiform neurofibromas (PNs). Progress developing nonsurgical therapy for PNs has been limited by a number of factors including 1) the lack of cell culture based models of PN, 2) a limited number of animal models of PN, and 3) limited access of investigators to primary PN tissue from NF1 patients. Although progress is being made in the development and utilization of animal models and cell culture models, the limited availability of primary patient tissue remains a gap. The goal of this project is to establish a biospecimen and xenograft bank from NF1 patients with PN and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors and to increase accessibility of these tissues to the research community through a collaboration with the CTF tissue repository.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4939902/wiki/235907","Christine Pratilas","Johns Hopkins Medical Institute","Plexiform Neurofibroma | MPNST | Cutaneous Neurofibroma","Neurofibromatosis 1","yes"]},{"rowId":153,"versionNumber":37,"values":["Cutaneous Neurofibroma Data Resource","syn4984604","syn11614202","Completed","Published","CTF","In 2013, CTF began a neurofibromatosis biobank to collect NF samples to better study the disease. With all samples being collected under the same protocol, the biobank enables comprehensive analysis of diverse NF samples. To showcase the value the biobank, CTF has kicked off a pilot project designed to characterize the molecular landscape of cutaneous neurofibromas (NF) that grow in NF1 patients, sponsored by the Children's Tumor Foundation. This project includes high-throughput data from 11 different patient tumors and matched blood samples. These data are then compared with one another to assess the distinct landscape of cutaneous NF for each patient.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4984604/wiki/247965","Salvatore La Rosa | Annette Bakker |  Justin Guinney","Children's Tumor Foundation | Sage Bionetworks | HudsonAlpha","Cutaneous Neurofibroma","Neurofibromatosis 1","yes"]}]}},"selectColumns":[{"name":"projectName","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"69191"},{"name":"id","columnType":"ENTITYID","id":"2510"},{"name":"projectFileviewId","columnType":"ENTITYID","id":"69192"},{"name":"projectStatus","columnType":"STRING","id":"69730"},{"name":"dataStatus","columnType":"STRING","id":"69731"},{"name":"fundingAgency","columnType":"STRING","id":"67409"},{"name":"summary","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"69194"},{"name":"summarySource","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"69732"},{"name":"projectLeads","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"69195"},{"name":"institutions","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"69196"},{"name":"tumorType","columnType":"STRING","id":"71360"},{"name":"diseaseFocus","columnType":"STRING","id":"69734"},{"name":"featured","columnType":"STRING","id":"71578"}],"columnModels":[{"id":"69191","name":"projectName","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"2510","name":"id","columnType":"ENTITYID"},{"id":"69192","name":"projectFileviewId","columnType":"ENTITYID"},{"id":"69730","name":"projectStatus","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":20,"facetType":"enumeration"},{"id":"69731","name":"dataStatus","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":20,"facetType":"enumeration"},{"id":"67409","name":"fundingAgency","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":20,"facetType":"enumeration"},{"id":"69194","name":"summary","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"69732","name":"summarySource","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"69195","name":"projectLeads","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"69196","name":"institutions","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"71360","name":"tumorType","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":80,"facetType":"enumeration"},{"id":"69734","name":"diseaseFocus","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":20,"facetType":"enumeration"},{"id":"71578","name":"featured","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":3,"enumValues":["yes"]}],"facets":[{"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"projectStatus","facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"value":"Active","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Completed","count":2,"isSelected":false}]},{"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"dataStatus","facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"value":"Partially Released","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Published","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Under Embargo","count":1,"isSelected":false}]},{"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"fundingAgency","facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"value":"CTF","count":2,"isSelected":false},{"value":"NTAP","count":1,"isSelected":false}]},{"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"tumorType","facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"value":"Cutaneous Neurofibroma","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Plexiform Neurofibroma | MPNST | Cutaneous Neurofibroma","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Schwannoma | Meningioma","count":1,"isSelected":false}]},{"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"diseaseFocus","facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"value":"Neurofibromatosis 1","count":2,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Neurofibromatosis 2","count":1,"isSelected":false}]}]}

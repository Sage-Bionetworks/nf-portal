NTAP uses a collaborative approach that brings together patients, clinicians, researchers, industry, and government to determine where resources are most effectively used to discover new treatments. NTAP's mission is to: 1) focus on therapeutics, 2) foster collaboration, 3) share results in an open and timely manner, and 4) streamline the research process. Exceptional partners are recruited to make these plans a reality, through both targeted programs and investigator-initiated proposals. NTAP invests in all areas of therapeutic discovery for plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas, with the ever-present final goal of an effective therapy for patients.","http://www.n-tap.org/","http://sagebionetworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/research_NTAP.png","NTAP","/Organizations-NTAP"]}]}},"selectColumns":[{"name":"organizationName","columnType":"STRING","id":"70041"},{"name":"abbreviation","columnType":"STRING","id":"70051"},{"name":"summary","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"69194"},{"name":"website","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"70039"},{"name":"logo","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"70040"},{"name":"fundingAgency","columnType":"STRING","id":"70052"},{"name":"organizationPath","columnType":"STRING","id":"70751"}],"columnModels":[{"id":"70041","name":"organizationName","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":150},{"id":"70051","name":"abbreviation","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":50,"enumValues":["CTF","DHART SPORE","NTAP"]},{"id":"69194","name":"summary","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"70039","name":"website","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"70040","name":"logo","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"70052","name":"fundingAgency","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":50,"enumValues":["CTF","NIH-NCI","NTAP"]},{"id":"70751","name":"organizationPath","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":50}],"facets":[]}

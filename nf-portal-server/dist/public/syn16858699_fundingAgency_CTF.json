Today, CTF is a widely recognized national nonprofit foundation, a leading force in the fight to end NF, and a model for other innovative research endeavors. CTF has partnered with Sage Bionetworks to create a pan-NF data portal available for NF researchers and other stakeholders. The portal contains molecular and clinical data coming from the many projects that the Foundation is managing. In particular, the Synodos consortia projects will use platforms built by Sage Bionetworks to execute their data analysis and integration, releasing their datasets in a timely fashion. The Synodos projects work with a 12-month embargo on data release, allowing their participants to share results in real-time within an exclusive space, and then releasing them after the confidentiality period. Many other projects that the Foundation is managing and sponsoring will also use this platform as a resource for making data available for the research community. The data being generated by CTF-funded projects include drug screening datasets, genomic characterization of model systems, multiplexed analysis, and several other publicly available datasets.","http://www.ctf.org/","http://www.ctf.org/images/uploads/resources/CTF_Logo_CMYK_C.eps","CTF","/Organizations-CTF"],"versionNumber":6,"rowId":0}]}},"selectColumns":[{"columnType":"STRING","name":"organizationName","id":"70041"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"abbreviation","id":"70051"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"summary","id":"69194"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"website","id":"70039"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"logo","id":"70040"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"fundingAgency","id":"70052"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"organizationPath","id":"70751"}],"columnModels":[{"columnType":"STRING","name":"organizationName","maximumSize":150,"id":"70041"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"abbreviation","maximumSize":50,"id":"70051","enumValues":["CTF","DHART SPORE","NTAP"]},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"summary","id":"69194"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"website","id":"70039"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"logo","id":"70040"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"fundingAgency","maximumSize":50,"id":"70052","enumValues":["CTF","NIH-NCI","NTAP"]},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"organizationPath","maximumSize":50,"id":"70751"}],"facets":[]}

Gliomagenesis in NF1 results in a heterogeneous spectrum of low- to high-grade neoplasms occurring during the entire lifes- pan of patients. The pattern of genetic and epigenetic alterations of glioma that develops in NF1 patients and the similarities with sporadic glioma remain unknown. Here, we present the molecular landscape of low- and high-grade gliomas in patients affected by NF1 (NF1-glioma). We found that the predisposing germline mutation of the NF1 gene was frequently converted to homozygosity and the somatic mutational load of NF1-glioma was influenced by age and grade.","CTF","224","2681351317","yes"]}]}},"selectColumns":[{"name":"id","columnType":"ENTITYID","id":"2510"},{"name":"datasetName","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"70044"},{"name":"diseaseFocus","columnType":"STRING","id":"56918"},{"name":"tumorType","columnType":"STRING","id":"39539"},{"name":"summary","columnType":"LARGETEXT","id":"69194"},{"name":"fundingAgency","columnType":"STRING","id":"38862"},{"name":"fileCount","columnType":"INTEGER","id":"70045"},{"name":"fileSize","columnType":"INTEGER","id":"31167"},{"name":"featured","columnType":"STRING","id":"71578"}],"columnModels":[{"id":"2510","name":"id","columnType":"ENTITYID"},{"id":"70044","name":"datasetName","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"56918","name":"diseaseFocus","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":50,"facetType":"enumeration"},{"id":"39539","name":"tumorType","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":50,"facetType":"enumeration"},{"id":"69194","name":"summary","columnType":"LARGETEXT"},{"id":"38862","name":"fundingAgency","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":50,"facetType":"enumeration"},{"id":"70045","name":"fileCount","columnType":"INTEGER"},{"id":"31167","name":"fileSize","columnType":"INTEGER"},{"id":"71578","name":"featured","columnType":"STRING","maximumSize":3,"enumValues":["yes"]}],"facets":[{"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"diseaseFocus","facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"value":"Multiple","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Neurofibromatosis 1","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Neurofibromatosis 2","count":2,"isSelected":false}]},{"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"tumorType","facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"value":"Low Grade Glioma | High Grade Gliom","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Multiple","count":1,"isSelected":false},{"value":"Schwannoma | Meningioma","count":2,"isSelected":false}]},{"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"fundingAgency","facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"value":"CTF","count":4,"isSelected":false}]}]}

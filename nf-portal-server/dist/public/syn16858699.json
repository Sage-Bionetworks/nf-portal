Today, CTF is a widely recognized national nonprofit foundation, a leading force in the fight to end NF, and a model for other innovative research endeavors. CTF has partnered with Sage Bionetworks to create a pan-NF data portal available for NF researchers and other stakeholders. The portal contains molecular and clinical data coming from the many projects that the Foundation is managing. In particular, the Synodos consortia projects will use platforms built by Sage Bionetworks to execute their data analysis and integration, releasing their datasets in a timely fashion. The Synodos projects work with a 12-month embargo on data release, allowing their participants to share results in real-time within an exclusive space, and then releasing them after the confidentiality period. Many other projects that the Foundation is managing and sponsoring will also use this platform as a resource for making data available for the research community. The data being generated by CTF-funded projects include drug screening datasets, genomic characterization of model systems, multiplexed analysis, and several other publicly available datasets.","http://www.ctf.org/","http://www.ctf.org/images/uploads/resources/CTF_Logo_CMYK_C.eps","CTF","/Organizations-CTF"],"versionNumber":6,"rowId":0},{"values":["Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP)","NTAP","The Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP) is dedicated to finding new treatments for individuals with plexiform neurofibromas and cutaneous neurofibromas. NTAP uses a collaborative approach that brings together patients, clinicians, researchers, industry, and government to determine where resources are most effectively used to discover new treatments. NTAP's mission is to: 1) focus on therapeutics, 2) foster collaboration, 3) share results in an open and timely manner, and 4) streamline the research process. Exceptional partners are recruited to make these plans a reality, through both targeted programs and investigator-initiated proposals. NTAP invests in all areas of therapeutic discovery for plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas, with the ever-present final goal of an effective therapy for patients.","http://www.n-tap.org/","http://sagebionetworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/research_NTAP.png","NTAP","/Organizations-NTAP"],"versionNumber":6,"rowId":1},{"values":["Developmental and Hyperactive Ras Tumor SPORE (DHART SPORE)","DHART SPORE","The Developmental and Hyperactive RAS Tumor SPORE (DHART SPORE) is an NCI project focused on identifying new treatment for tumors associated with NF1 mutations including plexiform neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, and radiation and chemotherapy-induced malignant neoplasms in NF1 patients.","https://www.dhartspore.org/","https://dhartspore.org/images/logo.png","NIH-NCI","/Organizations-DHART-SPORE"],"versionNumber":7,"rowId":2}]}},"selectColumns":[{"columnType":"STRING","name":"organizationName","id":"70041"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"abbreviation","id":"70051"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"summary","id":"69194"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"website","id":"70039"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"logo","id":"70040"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"fundingAgency","id":"70052"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"organizationPath","id":"70751"}],"columnModels":[{"columnType":"STRING","name":"organizationName","maximumSize":150,"id":"70041"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"abbreviation","maximumSize":50,"id":"70051","enumValues":["CTF","DHART SPORE","NTAP"]},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"summary","id":"69194"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"website","id":"70039"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"logo","id":"70040"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"fundingAgency","maximumSize":50,"id":"70052","enumValues":["CTF","NIH-NCI","NTAP"]},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"organizationPath","maximumSize":50,"id":"70751"}],"facets":[]}

We aim to adapt our optimized high-throughput 3D ring approach to develop a novel preclinical cNF model.  My laboratory has developed a robust high-throughput system to establish tumor organoids using a specific geometry to minimize sample handling and cell seeding density. By seeding cells in Matrigel in a mini-ring format we are able to routinely generate organoids from cell lines and primary samples in a format suitable for automation and high-throughput drug screenings. The approach does not necessitate of a priori cell expansion and allows to pinpoint drug sensitivities in within 5-6 days, hence avoiding most of the issues that arise from sample senescence and/or accumulation of genetic changes that can occur with prolonged time in culture. Our method is particularly suited to sustain growth of clinically relevant heterogeneous primary samples, both malignant as well as benign such as Schwann cells or fibroblasts. A single clinical sample can provide sufficient material to screen hundreds of drugs and identify individual drug susceptibilities. Here we aim to extend our proven method to cNF specimens to establish a reliable pre-clinical model. We will use primary samples obtained from NF1 patients and establish cNF organoids to elucidate disease biology and enable therapeutic testing. We anticipate collecting n=10 samples from adult NF1 patients through established collaborations with the UCLA NF clinic. We will characterize the tissues by histopathology and next generation sequencing (NGS) and determine whether the cNF 3D models recapitulate all the major features of the tumor of origin.

In this regard, inhibition of stromal cell (mast cells, macrophages) function in preclinical genetically-engineered mice resulted in attenuated plexiform neurofibroma growth. In addition to fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages, the NF1-deficient Schwann cells in cNFs often grow in proximity to terminal nerve endings.

There are few therapeutic options, and the vast majority of people with these cancers will die within 5 years of diagnosis. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathobiology of these tumors and the identification of seemingly-promising therapeutic targets using a single mouse MPNST model system (NPCis mice and derivative cell lines), no investigational agents have demonstrated efficacy following translation to human clinical trials. However, there is limited genetic diversity being modeled in these systems, which does not capture the full spectrum of genetic diversity that characterizes human NF1-MPNSTs. In this regard, p53 loss, a common feature of the currently-used preclinical models, is observed in a minority of human MPNSTs. We hypothesize that one of the major reasons that rationally-chosen drugs underperform in human clinical trials is that the preclinical models used to discover and evaluate promising therapeutic agents do not capture the genetic heterogeneity of the human cancer.

We will treat cells with the asunaprevir (ASv) chemical compound at different time points to assess any cellular and molecular changes, either in intact cells or isolated populations (SOX10::GFP+ neural crest cells, CD49d+ Schwann cell precursors and EGFR+ Schwann cells). The goal of this project is to generate a viable human Schwann cell model for cNF and identify differences in susceptibility to NF1 loss in different stages of Schwann cell development. In addition, we will provide the tunable and reversible method of control of NF1 expression (culminated in NF1-/SMASh hESCs) to the general neurofibroma and neurofibromatosis research community.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11374349/wiki/488828","Gabsang Lee","Johns Hopkins University","Cutaneous Neurofibroma","Neurofibromatosis 1"],"versionNumber":22,"rowId":188}]}},"selectColumns":[{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"projectName","id":"69191"},{"columnType":"ENTITYID","name":"id","id":"2510"},{"columnType":"ENTITYID","name":"projectFileviewId","id":"69192"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"projectStatus","id":"69730"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"dataStatus","id":"69731"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"fundingAgency","id":"67409"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"summary","id":"69194"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"summarySource","id":"69732"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"projectLeads","id":"69195"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"institutions","id":"69196"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"tumorType","id":"39539"},{"columnType":"STRING","name":"diseaseFocus","id":"69734"}],"columnModels":[{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"projectName","id":"69191"},{"columnType":"ENTITYID","name":"id","id":"2510"},{"columnType":"ENTITYID","name":"projectFileviewId","id":"69192"},{"columnType":"STRING","facetType":"enumeration","name":"projectStatus","maximumSize":20,"id":"69730"},{"columnType":"STRING","facetType":"enumeration","name":"dataStatus","maximumSize":20,"id":"69731"},{"columnType":"STRING","facetType":"enumeration","name":"fundingAgency","maximumSize":20,"id":"67409"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"summary","id":"69194"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"summarySource","id":"69732"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"projectLeads","id":"69195"},{"columnType":"LARGETEXT","name":"institutions","id":"69196"},{"columnType":"STRING","facetType":"enumeration","name":"tumorType","maximumSize":50,"id":"39539"},{"columnType":"STRING","facetType":"enumeration","name":"diseaseFocus","maximumSize":20,"id":"69734"}],"facets":[{"facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"count":23,"isSelected":false,"value":"Active"},{"count":21,"isSelected":false,"value":"Completed"}],"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"projectStatus"},{"facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"count":7,"isSelected":false,"value":"None"},{"count":1,"isSelected":false,"value":"Partially Released"},{"count":6,"isSelected":false,"value":"Published"},{"count":30,"isSelected":false,"value":"Under Embargo"}],"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"dataStatus"},{"facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"count":44,"isSelected":false,"value":"NTAP"}],"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"fundingAgency"},{"facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"count":11,"isSelected":false,"value":"Cutaneous Neurofibroma"},{"count":2,"isSelected":false,"value":"Low Grade Glioma"},{"count":3,"isSelected":false,"value":"MPNST"},{"count":26,"isSelected":false,"value":"Plexiform Neurofibroma"},{"count":2,"isSelected":false,"value":"Plexiform Neurofibroma | MPNST"}],"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"tumorType"},{"facetType":"enumeration","facetValues":[{"count":1,"isSelected":false,"value":"Multiple"},{"count":43,"isSelected":false,"value":"Neurofibromatosis 1"}],"concreteType":"org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.table.FacetColumnResultValues","columnName":"diseaseFocus"}]}

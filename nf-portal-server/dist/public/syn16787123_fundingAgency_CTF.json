The end goal of this effort is to find new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of two primary NF2-related tumors: schwannoma and meningioma. The expectation is to take the work from discovery to pre-clinical development, resulting in the development of an Investigational New Drug (IND) for NF2.

While the clinical aspects of NF1 are well characterized and the pathogenesis of plexiform neurofibromas has been widely studied, surprisingly little is known about the genetic and epigenetic changes in the NF1 mutant glioma. This has hindered the development of effective therapies for NF1-mutant cancers. To address this challenge and uncover the driver genes in NF1-glioma, The team will analyze whole-exome and transcriptome data from glioma samples of pediatric and adult NF1 patients. Alterations in the genetic networks will be contextualized in the natural genetic and cellular environment of a specific tumor, and the key driving modules on which specific NF1-glioma subgroups rely for growth, survival and progression will be identified. With this information in hand, we can target the critical alterations with specific drugs, often already available for other types of diseases. The specific aims are to (1) comprehensively characterize the genomic and epigenetic landscape of NF1 gliomas from patients of all age groups, (2) identify driver genetic alterations in NF1-gliomas from the integration of somatic copy number variations, mutations and gene fusions (translocations), (3) reconstruct a somatic alteration network for the inference of mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of genetic aberrations in NF1-gliomas and (4) validate the functional significance of the inferred alterations in neural systems in vitro and in vivo, and target therapeutically key genetic nodes with highly specific inhibitors.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6135075/wiki/470497","Antonio Iaverone","Columbia University | University of Sannio","Low Grade Glioma","Neurofibromatosis 1"],"versionNumber":22,"rowId":161},{"values":["Evotec Drug Target Research","syn7239560","syn11614208","Completed","Published","CTF","A drug-target database was built by Evotec using publically available data in order to define targets of the Minnesota Synodos NF1 screening molecules.

Such screens are conducted with an array of molecules (panels of oncology drugs, drugs for other indications, and compounds with possibly unknown bioactivity), ultimately measuring a biological change within a disease model. While these screens can yield valuable hits, they also present the challenge of identifying the target(s) that mediate the effect seen in the screen for several reasons. For example, many drugs have a polypharmacologic target profile making it hard to identify which targets are biologically relevant for a given drug. Furthermore, some libraries contain molecules for which drug-target studies have never been conducted. To address these challenges, we developed an application that enables exploration of the chemical-biological interaction space. Drug-target interaction data from ChEMBL (CC BY-SA 3.0), ChemicalProbes.org (CC BY-SA 3.0), DGIdb (open), DrugBank (CC BY-NC 4.0, used with approval), and Klaeger, et al, 2017 was collected for over 280,000 molecules. In addition, when quantitative data were obtained, pChEMBL values were calculated. Each molecule was annotated with a name and chemical structure, and every target was annotated with protein & gene identifiers. An interactive web interface was developed using the R Shiny platform and cheminformatics R packages.","https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11672851/wiki/513661","Robert Allaway | Sara Gosline","Sage Bionetworks",null,"Multiple"],"versionNumber":22,"rowId":184},{"values":["NF Cell Line Compound Screens","syn11817821","syn11818313","Completed","Partially Released","CTF","This project created the first college course in drug screening, and specifically screened for drugs for NF1 and NF2 related tumor types.
